   IAC DO RANDOMLY-LOSE

      The sender  of this command  REQUESTS that the receiver, or grants
      the receiver permission to, randomly lose.

   IAC DON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE

3.  Default.

   WON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE

   DON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE

   i.e., random lossage will not happen.

4.  Motivation for the option.

   Several  hosts appear  to provide  random  lossage,  such  as  system
   crashes,  lost data,  incorrectly functioning programs, etc., as part
   of their services.   These services are often undocumented and are in
   general  quite confusing  to the novice  user.   A general  means  is
   needed to allow the user to disable these features.
